# DeepCap-Kcr
This code is for the article 'DeepCap-Kcr: accurate identification and investigation of protein lysine crotonylation (Kcr) sites based on capsule network'
Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information and help, email : jhabindra@jbnu.ac.kr

We used python version 3.6 and keras version 2.1.1 using TensorFlow backend

We have also a web-based application for predicting Kcr sites at the following link: http://nsclbio.jbnu.ac.kr/DeepCap-Kcr/
